# How to use

On the start page, you are asked for a Bible book, chapter, verse(s), edition, and Language. The Bible books, chapters, and verses include the Old and New Testaments. To add more than 1 verse, use the optional "to verse" option. You do this by putting the start verse on the first textbox and then the second on the box under the letters "to" (EX: Box 1: 7, Box 2: 9, verses 7 to 9). Please note that SOME books, chapters, and verses may NOT be available in some Bible editions OR languages. Bible editions are different versions of the Bible, these include the _New Word Translation_, King James, etc. Languages are limited, and upcoming updates will add more.
