# How to use

On the start page, you are asked for a Bible book, chapter, verse(s), edition, and Language. The Bible books, chapters, and verses include the Old and New Testaments. To add more than 1 verse, use the optional "to verse" option. You do this by putting the start verse on the first textbox and then the second on the box under the letters "to" (EX: Box 1: 7, Box 2: 9, verses 7 to 9). Please note that SOME books, chapters, and verses may NOT be available in some Bible editions OR languages. Bible editions are different versions of the Bible, these include the _New Word Translation_, King James, etc. Languages are limited, and upcoming updates will add more. There is a Local language that uses your local language in your area. Once filled, press "Generate Link" and the link will generate. If there is an invalid chapter or verse, perhaps Chapter 837 or verse -84, the link will also be invalid.
